    <h1>Semantic Tags</h1>
    <p>Semantic tags are HTML elements that provide meaning to the content they enclose. They help search engines and assistive technologies understand the structure and content of a webpage. Some common semantic tags include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code>: Represents the introductory content or a group of navigational links.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>: Represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code>: Represents the main content of the document.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code>: Represents a self-contained composition in a document, such as a blog post or news article.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code>: Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as sidebars or call-out boxes.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>: Represents the footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.</li>
    </ul>
